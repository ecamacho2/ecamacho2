<h1>Project Overview </h1> 
<li>I would like to make a website about my cousins restaurant similar to other websites providing a menu and other categories </li>

<h1>Features list</h1>

<li> Well I want to make the website interactive like being able to see different categories under the menu bar just by hovering over it.</li>

<li> I want to put some imagies of the food in the background of the webpage or have some imagies of their food.</li>

<li>Im gonna give a breif summary on the front of the page about the restaurant and in the bottom I wanna include the socials of the restaurant and maybe video from youtube about their food</li>

<li> I kinda just want to make it look like any regulor restaurant website like villa rosa for example</li>
